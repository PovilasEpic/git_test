Every day I do this
Never fear of losing
And when I get up in the game
Yo I’m pure improvement
A real problem, but I solve em’
All facts proven
And if you think I’m go’n fold
Then you talkin' foolish
Y’all wanna win let me spin boy
All dunks aside I’m super fly
Like I’m hangin' off the rim boy
I been winnin' for my kinfolk
And I put on for my city
From the intro, let’s go!
I put that time in
My pride is out the roof
I get that grind in
So ima tell the truth
I get my grind on
U know pressure makes all of these diamonds
I tell them get back
Step back
Fast track
Big laps
Big facts

Get out the way, now
Move forward

For my city for my town (I’ll do whatever that it takes)
Imma go and get the crown (Oh)
Imma go another round (Oh)

For my city for my town (I’ll do whatever that it takes)

started from the ground up
training
getting wound up
channeling it into something
moving up a round
crossing over
passing by

No cop can keep score
Hittin' all the years
I never thought I'd cross

(I STAND TALL!)
because i wish to win
(NO! GOOD BYE!)

If you wanna challenge tell me rookie run up on me now
